    <h1>Doll</h1>
    <h2>Yes</h2>
    <p>Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me
        Is it true that pain is beauty?
        Does a new face come with a warranty?
        Will a pretty face make it better?
        Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me
        How did you afford her surgery?
        Do you swear you'll stay forever
        Even if her face don't stay together
        Even if her face don't stay together</p>
